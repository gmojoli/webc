# This file lists the kernel cmdline options that should be passed to
# the kernel by the bootloader when booting this particular git
# revision. It is used by the image generation to pass onto lb config
# --bootappend-live, as well as by the live-config.sh script when
# generating new bootloader configs during an upgrade.
#
# This file should contain exactly one non-comment line, which is
# inserted into the "append" line of the bootloader config.
